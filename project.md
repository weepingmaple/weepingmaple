## Project Plan: Automating Chef Inspec with AWS Systems Manager

**Project Goal:** Implement automated compliance scans and reporting using Chef Inspec and AWS Systems Manager.

**Project Overview:**

This project aims to leverage the capabilities of both Chef Inspec and AWS Systems Manager to automate compliance checks and reporting for your infrastructure. By utilizing Systems Manager Run Command and State Manager association, Inspec profiles will be automatically triggered on targeted EC2 instances, facilitating continuous compliance monitoring.

**Project Deliverables:**

* **Defined compliance criteria:** Establish clear and detailed compliance requirements for your infrastructure using Inspec profiles.
* **Automated Inspec execution:** Configure Systems Manager Run Command to execute Inspec profiles on designated EC2 instances.
* **Centralized results storage:** Store Inspec scan results in Systems Manager Parameter Store for centralized access and analysis.
* **Compliance reporting dashboard:** Develop a dashboard using CloudWatch or other tools to visualize compliance status and trends.

**Project Phases:**

**Phase 1: Planning and Design (1 week)**

* Define compliance requirements and identify applicable Inspec profiles.
* Analyze target EC2 instances and configure Systems Manager Run Command document for Inspec execution.
* Design the data structure for storing Inspec results in Systems Manager Parameter Store.
* Plan the reporting strategy and dashboard design.

**Phase 2: Implementation (2 weeks)**

* Develop and test the Systems Manager Run Command document for Inspec execution.
* Configure Systems Manager State Manager association to automatically trigger Inspec scans on target EC2 instances.
* Implement data storage mechanisms for Inspec results in Systems Manager Parameter Store.
* Develop the compliance reporting dashboard using CloudWatch or other tools.

**Phase 3: Testing and Validation (1 week)**

* Perform comprehensive testing of the automated Inspec execution process.
* Verify the accuracy and completeness of Inspec results storage and reporting.
* Refine the reporting dashboard for optimal usability and visualization.

**Phase 4: Deployment and Monitoring (1 week)**

* Deploy the automated Inspec configuration to production.
* Monitor the execution of Inspec profiles and review compliance reports regularly.
* Address any identified non-compliance issues and update Inspec profiles as needed.

**Project Resources:**

* Dedicated personnel with expertise in Chef Inspec and AWS Systems Manager.
* Chef Inspec profiles for your compliance requirements.
* Access to AWS Management Console or CLI.
* CloudWatch dashboards or other reporting tools.

**Project Timeline:**

* **Project Start Date:** December 07, 2023
* **Project End Date:** January 04, 2024

**Project Success Criteria:**

* Automated Inspec scans run successfully on target EC2 instances.
* Inspec results are stored accurately and readily accessible.
* Compliance reports provide clear and actionable insights.
* Identified non-compliance issues are addressed promptly.

**Contingency Plans:**

* **Delayed access to resources:** Prioritize critical tasks and adjust the timeline as needed.
* **Unexpected technical challenges:** Collaborate with the relevant teams and utilize available resources to find solutions.
* **Changes in compliance requirements:** Update Inspec profiles and reporting dashboards to reflect the new requirements.

**Project Benefits:**

* Improved compliance posture and reduced risk of security vulnerabilities.
* Enhanced efficiency and cost savings by automating manual tasks.
* Increased visibility into infrastructure configuration and compliance status.
* Proactive identification and resolution of compliance issues.

**Next Steps:**

* Assign project roles and responsibilities.
* Gather detailed information about compliance requirements and existing infrastructure.
* Begin development and testing of the automation components.
* Establish a communication plan for project updates and troubleshooting.

This project plan serves as a guide to implement automated Chef Inspec execution using AWS Systems Manager. By following this plan and adapting it to your specific needs, you can achieve significant improvements in your infrastructure compliance and management.
